# Mollap

Java exercise made by my mentor  [David Gelpi](https://github.com/dfleta). The official repository can be found [here](https://github.com/dfleta/mollap-intercepting-filter) with David UML Class diagram.

I have made a few small changes to the design only leaving the weight of the task execution to the ProgrammerTasks class. **Nothing very important!**
